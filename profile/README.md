Today's world is making electricity using non renewable resources and in future, this may lead to depletion of these resources. So, we are here with our idea to move towards sustainable development. we are promoting the use of solar power plant to generate electricity

The extra electrical energy which is being produced using solar power plant can converted into credits(money). This will inspire the nation to go for the sustainable sources of electricity.

we have made a platform for virtual transfer and trading of electricity. Here the users have fairly likely chances to gain profit. government can also earn through brokerage charges.

we have build a blockchain based decentralized report to store the history, account and expenses of the users. we have created a React based front-end for seamless access and smooth interaction of the users. our platform uses Firebase for providing better security and privacy. we have use the tech stack like Taipy, Fastn, MongoDB, Github, Hedera, React, Node, FastAPI and Arweave.

throughout the making of this application, we came across many difficulties. Thanks to the supportive Mentors and the Sponsors for proving us the time to time guidance.

we are proud that we were able to complete our project on time. Our Project will be produced beneficial of the upcoming generation as we are trying for making the country pollution free.

## What experiance did you get?
Throughout this hackathon, I with my team have gain some valuable experiences. we have learned the value of time and some new Tech Stacks like Taipy, Fastn, Hedara and Arweave.

## What's next for Virtual Electricity Transfer and Trading
we are planning to take our idea more higher and will try to collaborate with the government to make our country as the GLOBAL HUB FOR SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY.
